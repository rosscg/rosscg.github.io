title: Welcome To... App
---

*'Welcome To...'* is a 'roll and write' game designed by Benoit Tupin, where players are architects in 1950s America competing to build the most desirable suburb.

Roll and write games provide each player with a sheet of paper and pencil with which to record their decisions, and a set of variables are generated each turn. Traditionally, this is done with a set of dice (hence the term 'roll'); in 'Welcome To...' decks of cards are used instead. This app replicates the drawing of these cards.

A printer friendly version is [also available](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/182959/w2-score-sheet-printer-friendly). Scoresheet apps can be downloaded for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/welcome-to-your-perfect-home/id1358077007) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluecocker.welcome) which handle the score calculations automatically.

The rules of the game can be found on [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162102/welcome-english-rules-20) or the [publisher's site](https://www.bluecocker.com/jeux/Welcome/Regles_fr&en.pdf). Tap the City Plan cards to mark as 'approved' and remove the higher points value.

The software is written in [Godot 3.1.2](https://godotengine.org/) using GDScript. Cards from the main deck are drawn randomly without replacement while the objective deck is drawn with replacement.
