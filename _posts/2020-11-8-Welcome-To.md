['Welcome To...'](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867/welcome) is a 'Roll and Write' game, where players compete to build the best 1950s American town.

Roll and write games provide each player with a sheet of paper and pencil with which to record their decisions, and a set of variables are generated each turn. Traditionally, this is done with a set of dice (hence the term 'roll'); in 'Welcome To...', several decks of cards are used. This app replicates the drawing of these cards.
