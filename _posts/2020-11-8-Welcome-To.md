title: Welcome To... App

*'Welcome To...'* is a 'roll and write' game designed by Benoit Tupin, where players are architects in 1950s America competing to build the most desirable suburb.

Roll and write games provide each player with a sheet of paper and pencil with which to record their decisions, and a set of variables are generated each turn. Traditionally, this is done with a set of dice (hence the term 'roll'); in 'Welcome To...', several decks of cards are used. This app replicates the drawing of these cards.
