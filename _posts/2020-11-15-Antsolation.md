#### Instructions:
Ants periodically spawn and seek out nearby resources to harvest. Once their carrying capacity is reached, they will return to the nearest nest to deposit their resources. Upon spotting an enemy ant, they may choose to either attack or ignore them. Ants have limited vision, and will wander randomly until they find an item of interest. Once a nest reaches maturity and has enough food, it will spawn queens, who will create new nests. Ants can die from combat and old age.

The player can adjust the stats of newborn ants by opening the menu in the top-left. Once a player is happy with their species of ant, they can export their genetics strain to the server. By passing their unique player ID on to a friend, the friend is then able to import the player's ants into their own game as the red species. In this way, players are able to compete with each other asynchronously.

The game is designed to be slow-paced, supporting an contemplative play style.
