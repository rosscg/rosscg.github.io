I am passionate about bringing together my experience as a first responder and background in computer science to create novel solutions which save lives. My research interests focus on leveraging information systems and artificial intelligence for social good. In particular, designing methods by which to make social media data more useful to disaster response organisations during crisis events.

I teach Requirements Engineering in the [Oxford Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) and am employed as the Junior Dean at [Harris Manchester College](http://www.hmc.ox.ac.uk/).
